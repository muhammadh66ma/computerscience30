 The difference is an IS-a relationship is inheritance. The classes which inherit are known as sub classes an example would be car which is a sub class inherited from vehicle
 while Has-a relationship is composition.
 
 2)
 It would be available to both due to as long as you don't override it 
 
 3)
 An abstract method is a forces its immediate subclass to implement the function of all abstract methods. 
 Where as overriding is optional and is not always a necessity for the subclasses. 
 
 4)
  An abstract class allows you to create functionality that subclasses can implement or override. An interface only allows you to define functionality, not implement it
  
 6)
 a) All methods in Wo have to be public and abstract which means doThat is also one 
 
 b) It is a interface
 
 c) doThat() method is implemented withen Roo because the methods of an interface must be defined in the class that implements the method's interface.
 
 d) The methods in a Roo object are  doNow(), doThis(), doThat().
 
 e.The doThis() implementation in Roo overrides the doThis() implementation in Bo.
 
 f.In Roo, the expression super(1) assigns 1 to the variable x from Bo.
 
 
g.No, once it is overridden, the compiler no longer recognizes the do(This() method in Bo.


h.Yes, a method in Roo can call the doThis() method in Bo by using the main word super.
